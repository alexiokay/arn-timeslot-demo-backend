# arn-timeslot-demo-backend
Web Portal ARN-Timeslot is a project aimed at optimizing and automating the scheduling of shipments for Arrow Electronics. The project involves creating a web portal where carriers can request timeslots for their shipments and Arrow employees can manage and approve these requests. The system includes features such as a visual representation of free timeslots per calendar, an admin module for setting workable times and maximum truck capacity, and an API for fetching and updating data in a pSQL server. The system also includes user authentication and authorization features, as well as the ability to create carrier accounts with sub-accounts. This project was developed using Django and Django Rest Framework.
